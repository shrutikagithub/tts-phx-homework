This is the homework project we will be working on for the rest of this course.

## Notes

hello

An important section of github to look at is is the [Pull Requests](https://github.com/m3talsmith/tts-phx-homework/pulls) section. In this section you'll have the various changes that others have requested you pull in.

**CW:** First time using Git in any way, shape or form. And yes, this is my first official note in a README file.
